## Introduction

As a university student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), I've embarked on a journey to master Django, a powerful web framework for Python. This repository documents my learning path, code snippets, and eventually, the development of a professional software project using Django.

## Learning Progress

My learning journey is organized into several phases, each building on the knowledge gained in the previous one. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Basics of Django**:
   - Introduction to Django and setting up the development environment.
   - Creating simple web applications, views, and templates.
   - Understanding models, databases, and migrations.

2. **Intermediate Django**:
   - Building more complex applications with authentication and user management.
   - Implementing forms, handling user input, and validations.
   - Incorporating third-party libraries and packages.

3. **Advanced Django**:
   - Developing RESTful APIs using Django REST framework.
   - Integrating frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js with Django.
   - Scaling and optimizing Django applications for production.

4. **Professional Project**:
   - Planning, designing, and implementing a real-world project.
   - Collaborating with others, using version control, and managing project documentation.
   - Deploying the project to a production server.
